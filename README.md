# EPC069-12

This is a simple, one file PHP script that lets you create the payload for a EPC069-12 QR-Code.

A QR-Code that implements the EPC069-12 standard contains information for SEPA credit transfers. It can be used on invoices to make it easier for the payer to initiate a credit transfer via a mobile banking app.

This code does not validate IBAN and BIC. It does also not return a QR-Code, just the string that can be used to create the code.
